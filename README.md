# Automated-Image-Captioning
The image caption generator employs deep learning and computer vision to add descriptive captions to images. It leverages the Xception model for extracting image features and utilizes LSTM for generating captions. These models are trained using the Imagenet dataset, resulting in accurate and contextually relevant captions for images.
