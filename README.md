# **IMAGE CAPTION GENERATOR**
In today's digitally-driven world, there has been a surge in the development and use of various generative models. One such fascinating application is the **Image caption generator**. Image caption generator is an innovative model that combines **Computer vision** and **Natural language processing** techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. They enhance accessibility, improve image search, and foster creative expression, revolutionizing the way we interact withÂ visualÂ content.

**ðŸ‘‰  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
CNNs are widely used for image processing tasks. They are effective at automatically extracting relevant features from images. In the context of image captioning, a pre-trained CNN such as VGG16 is used as a feature extractor. The output of the CNN is a feature vector that represents the high-level features of theÂ inputÂ image.

**ðŸ‘‰ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):**
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. In the image captioning task, LSTM is used to generate a caption word by word based on the extracted image features. At each time step, the LSTM takes the previous hidden state, the previous word embedding, and the image features as inputs and predicts the next word inÂ theÂ sequence.

**ðŸ‘‰ Implementation:**

a. Preprocess the image and text data.

b. Define the CNN encoder model by removing the last classification layer from a pre-trained CNN model and adding a dense layer to produce the image feature vector.

c. Define the LSTM decoder model, which takes the image features, previous word embeddings, and previous hidden states as inputs and predicts the next word.

d. Define the loss function, typically using cross-entropy, and compile the model.

e. Train the model using the preprocessed data, adjusting the weights of both the CNN encoder and LSTM decoder.

f. Generate captions for new images by feeding the image through theÂ trainedÂ model.


ðŸ“Œ To expedite the training process and achieve faster results, utilizing a **Kaggle notebook** with **GPU** support is recommended for building an image caption generator.
